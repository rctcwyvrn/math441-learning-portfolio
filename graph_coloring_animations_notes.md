title: "Graph coloring animations: Notes"
---

These are notes on the greedy graph coloring algorithms that I animated using [this script](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/math441-learning-portfolio/blob/master/graph_coloring_animations/graph_coloring_greedy_strategies.py). A static version of the website generated by that script can be found [here](/math441-learning-portfolio/post/graph_coloring_animations/)
