These are notes on the greedy graph coloring algorithms that I animated using [this script](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/math441-learning-portfolio/blob/master/graph_coloring_animations/graph_coloring_greedy_strategies.py). A static version of the website generated by that script can be found [here](/math441-learning-portfolio/post/graph_coloring_animations/)

So, why did I do this?

Well to be honest, because I was really curious. When we looked at `networkx` in lecture I saw that it provided support for a whole bunch of greedy algorithms and wanted to take a look at them. But instead of doing the smart thing and just reading up on what each algorithm does and why one might choose one over the other, I spent a long time figuring out how to generate animations for each method and making it into a nice website.

I was hoping after making a nice website and format for the webpage I would be able to generate a bunch of graphs and write about differences that I noticed between the different methods but it turns out that actually seeing these differences via the animations is still really hard!

But I had already sunk all this time into making the animations so I was stuck with it, so here's my best attempts at identifying intuitively and visually what each greedy algorithm is useful for and why someone might choose one over the other. I've unfortunately spent so much time working on my other portfolio entries that I don't have time to look up if any of these are remotely correct but oh well!
