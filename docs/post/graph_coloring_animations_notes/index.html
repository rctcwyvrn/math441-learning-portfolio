<p>So, why did I do this?</p>
<p>Well to be honest, because I was really curious. When we looked at <code>networkx</code> in lecture I saw that it provided support for a whole bunch of greedy algorithms and wanted to take a look at them. But instead of doing the smart thing and just reading up on what each algorithm does and why one might choose one over the other, I spent a long time figuring out how to generate animations for each method and making it into a nice website.</p>
<p>I was hoping after making a nice website and format for the webpage I would be able to generate a bunch of graphs and write about differences that I noticed between the different methods but it turns out that actually seeing these differences via the animations is still really hard!</p>
<p>But I had already sunk all this time into making the animations so I was stuck with it, so here&rsquo;s my best attempts at identifying intuitively and visually what each greedy algorithm is useful for and why someone might choose one over the other. I&rsquo;ve unfortunately spent so much time working on my other portfolio entries that I don&rsquo;t have time to look up if any of these are remotely correct but oh well!</p>
